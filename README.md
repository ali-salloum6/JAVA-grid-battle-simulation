# JAVA grid battle simulation

Date of completion: 12th of November 2020

This project is coursework that simulates a 10x10 grid where three kinds of creatures exist (Rocks, Papers, Scissors) which interact in different ways depending on their kind. For example, capital creatures are aggressive and try to attack the weaker ones whereas small creatures try to escape and breed.

## Value:

I got the opportunity to get more used to JAVA syntax in addition to applying main OOP principles in an effective way and organizing relatively large projects. Moreover, I documented my code well following JavaDoc rules and conventions.

#### Note: to run the code use JDK 1.8 and the simulation will start in the terminal.
